## Organization System
This repository uses a structured organization system for professional project management. Each major area has clear boundaries:

- **Company Work**: Clearly separated by employer/client
- **Shared Resources**: Reusable libraries and tools
- **Personal Development**: Separate space for personal projects
- **Archives**: Historical projects maintained for reference

## Getting Started
1. Check the appropriate company/client folder for your work area
2. Shared libraries are in the "50-59 Shared Resources" section
3. Development tools and scripts are organized by type and platform
4. Personal projects are kept separate from professional work

## Maintenance
- Projects are archived when completed
- Shared resources are updated centrally
- Clear separation maintained between different clients/employers
- Regular cleanup of temporary and experimental work

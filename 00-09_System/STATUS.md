# System Management - Current Status

## Current Objective
**Primary Focus**: Complete system organization and resolve Parsec USB driver issues

## Current Phase Progress
### Active Task: Parsec Driver Removal and System Organization
- [x] Identified root cause of USB connection sounds (Parsec virtual drivers)
- [x] Located driver uninstall paths:
  - `C:\Program Files\Parsec Virtual Display Driver\uninstall.exe`
  - `C:\Program Files\Parsec Virtual USB Adapter Driver\uninstall.exe`
- [x] Organized repository structure according to global guidelines
- [x] Created proper directory structure (scripts/, docs/, .temp/)
- [x] Moved all maintenance scripts to scripts/ directory
- [x] Converted documentation files from .txt to .md format
- [x] Created core documentation files (WORKPLAN.md, STATUS.md)
- [ ] **NEXT**: Manual uninstallation of Parsec drivers via Programs and Features
- [ ] **THEN**: System reboot to verify USB sound issue resolved
- [ ] **FINALLY**: Test Windows Update after driver removal

## Dependencies and Blockers
- **Manual Action Required**: Parsec drivers must be uninstalled manually through Windows Programs and Features (appwiz.cpl)
- **System Reboot Required**: After driver removal to fully clear virtual devices
- **No Technical Blockers**: All technical analysis complete

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Immediate**: Elimination of continuous USB connect/disconnect sounds
2. **Secondary**: Resolution of Windows Update error 0x8007007F
3. **Long-term**: Clean, organized system maintenance environment

## Recent Activities (Last Session)
- Analyzed Event Viewer logs and identified 100+ Parsec USB events per hour
- Created comprehensive driver removal scripts and analysis tools
- Reorganized entire repository structure to follow global development guidelines
- Established proper documentation hierarchy and converted all files to markdown format

## Next Focus
**Manual Steps Required by User**:
1. Open Programs and Features (Windows + R â†’ appwiz.cpl)
2. Find and uninstall "Parsec Virtual Display Driver"
3. Find and uninstall "Parsec Virtual USB Adapter Driver" 
4. Reboot system
5. Verify USB sounds have stopped

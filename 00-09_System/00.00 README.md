## Overview
This repository has been reorganized using the Johnny Decimal system to provide clear structure and easy navigation across all projects, tools, and resources.

## Quick Navigation

  - **System Administration**: WSL backup/restore system (`settings/RestorePC/`)
- **10-19 SquareDivision**: Current employer projects and tools
- **20-29 Active Consulting**: Current consulting clients and projects
- **30-39 Active Development**: Personal and collaborative active projects
- **40-49 Previous Companies**: Historical employment projects (archived)
- **50-59 Shared Resources**: Libraries, tools, and shared components
- **60-69 Personal Projects**: Personal development and research
- **70-79 Archive**: Completed or deprecated projects
- **80-89 Templates & Standards**: Reusable templates and coding standards
- **90-99 Temporary**: Temporary work and experiments

## Quick Reference Numbers

## System Benefits
- **Unique IDs**: Each project has a unique number for quick reference
- **Natural Limits**: Maximum 100 projects per category prevents sprawl
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Easy to understand project relationships
- **Professional Separation**: Clear boundaries between employers/clients
- **Fast Navigation**: Develop muscle memory for number locations

## Navigation Tips
1. Use the ID numbers in conversations: "Check 21.01 for the latest updates"
2. Bookmark frequently used project IDs
3. The first digit (0-9) indicates the main area
4. The second digit (0-9) indicates the category within that area
5. The decimal number (01-99) identifies the specific project

## Structure Philosophy
The Johnny Decimal system enforces organizational discipline while providing flexibility within each category. It's designed to scale with business needs while maintaining clarity and ease of use.
